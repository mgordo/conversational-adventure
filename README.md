# conversational-adventure
A C based engine for conversational adventures, with one sample adventure. 
Authors: C. Carrascal, M. Gordo and A. Jimenez.

All you need to do to get it running is run 'make all' in the directory you download it. Unzip your adventure in the same directory, run './game' and you're good to go. A list of games will appear, select the one you want to play.


A game consists of 3 xml documents: one for the dialogue, one for the rules, and one for the world and objects. The documentation on how to create new xml files for new games can be found in the other documentation files within this folder.

The technical documentation was generated with doxygen and can be accesed with the index.html file within the html folder. 


As a sample, this project comes with its own adventure, 'Draco Dormiend Nunquam Titilandus', in which you become a Gryffindor student and you need to pass your potions exam. The very same morning of the exam, you wake up in the common room only to find you've been robbed. 

You will need to find all your ingredients and your book in order to have a shot a the exam...

Hope you enjoy playing it as much as we did developing it!
